# App modernization hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement the steps to modernize legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure by leveraging cloud services, while adding a mix of web and mobile services, all secured using Azure Active Directory.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build solutions for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure using cloud services, and implement a mix of web and mobile services secured by Azure Active Directory.

## Overview

The App Modernization hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and search, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

After lawyers affirmed that Contoso, Ltd. could legally store customer data in the cloud, Contoso created a strategy that capitalized on the capabilities of Microsoft Azure. Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in the lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Architecture diagram of the preferred solution. Mobile and web apps connect APIs and Azure Functions Proxies, secured by Azure AD, with application secrets stored in Key Vault. Redis Cache is used to improve application performance, and data is stored in SQL Server and Azure Blob Storage. PowerApps and Flow are used to enable business users to build mobile and web (CRUD) applications. Azure API Management is used to provide an API Store experience for developers.](media/unguided-image2.png "Solution architecture")

The solution begins with mobile apps (built for Android and iOS using **Xamarin**) and a website, both of which provide access to PolicyConnect. The website, hosted in a **Web App**, provides the user interface for browser-based clients, whereas the Xamarin Forms-based apps provide the UI to mobile devices. Both mobile app and website rely on web services hosted in an **API App**. In addition to the API App, a lightweight, serverless API is provided by **Azure Functions Proxies** to provide access to policy documents stored in **Blob Storage**. **Azure API Management** is used as a proof of concept for the future goal to create a API Store for development teams and affiliated partners. Sensitive configuration data, like connection strings, are stored in **Key Vault** and accessed from the API App or Web App on demand so that these settings never live in their file system. Full-text search of policy documents is enabled by the Indexer for **Blob Storage** (which indexes text in the Word and PDF documents) and stores the results in an **Azure Search** index. **PowerApps** enable authorized business users to build mobile and web create, read, update, delete (CRUD) applications that interact with **SQL Database** and Azure Storage, while **Microsoft Flow** enables orchestrations between services such as Office 365 email and services for sending mobile notifications. These orchestrations can be used independently of PowerApps or invoked by PowerApps to provide additional logic. The solution uses user and application identities maintained in **Azure AD**.

## Requirements

-   Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription).

-   **Global Administrator role** for Azure AD within your subscription.

-   Local machine or a virtual machine configured with (**complete the day before the lab!**):

    -   Visual Studio Community 2017 or greater

    -   Visual Studio 2017 workloads for:

        -   Azure development

        -   Mobile development with .NET

    -   SQL Server 2017 Express or greater

    -   SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

    -   PowerShell 1.1.0 or higher


## Exercise 1: Migrate the database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 15 minutes

Contoso Insurance has asked you to migrate their on-premises SQL database to Azure SQL Database. In this exercise, you will provision a new SQL Server in Azure, configure the firewall for that SQL Server, and then use SSMS to migrate the Contoso Insurance database from on-premises to Azure SQL Database.

### Task 1: Provision a SQL Server

In this task, you will create a SQL Server (logical server). You will not create the databases at this time since it will be created during the database migration step.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Provision a SQL Server (logical server) in Azure.

#### Exit criteria 

-   You have a SQL Server provisioned in Azure.

### Task 2: Configure SQL Server firewall

In this task, you will create a firewall rule to allow access to your SQL Server.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Create a firewall rule to allow all IP addresses to access the SQL Server.

#### Exit criteria 

-   Your firewall rule is active.

-   You can access your SQL Server from your (or your Lab VM's) IP address.

### Task 3: Migrate the on-premises SQL database to Azure

In this task, you will migrate the Contoso Insurance database from on-premises (Lab VM) into Azure SQL Database.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Use SSMS to deploy the Contoso Insurance database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

#### Exit criteria 

-   You are able to access the database and tables in Azure SQL Database via SSMS.

## Exercise 2: Provision App Services

Duration: 15 minutes

Contoso Insurance has asked you to provision resources in Azure for hosting their web and API applications. In this exercise you will create a Web App and an API App in Azure.

### Task 1: Create a Web App

In this task, you will provision a Web App and API App for hosting the Contoso Insurance applications in Azure.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Provision a Web App in Azure.

#### Exit criteria 

-   You are able to navigate to the landing page for your Web App in a browser.

### Task 1: Provision an API App

#### Tasks to complete

-   Provision an API App in Azure.

#### Exit criteria 

-   You have an API App provisioned in Azure.

## Exercise 3: Identity and security

Duration: 45 minutes

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) will be used to allow users to authenticate to the web app, PolicyConnect desktop app, mobile apps, and PowerApps solutions. Azure AD will also be used to manage application access to Key Vault secrets. You have been asked to create a new Azure AD Tenant and secure the application so only users from the tenant can log on.

>**Note**: Tasks 1 and 2 require global admin permissions on the Azure AD Tenant. Task 3 requires the permission to create an app in the Azure AD tenant. Task 1 and 2 cannot be completed if you use Microsoft Azure AD tenant.

### Task 1: Create a new Contoso user

In this task, you will create an Azure AD user account that will be used for authenticating against the web and mobile apps.

>**Note**: This task is valid only if you are a global administrator on the Azure AD tenant associated with your subscription.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Create a new Contoso user named **Contoso User** in your Azure AD tenant and retrieve the temporary password auto-generated by Azure AD for later reference.

#### Exit criteria

-   You have made note of the full username for later use. The username will be in the following format: contosouser@\[your tenant\].onmicrosoft.com.

-   You have saved the temporary password for later.

### Task 2: Register the Web API application

#### Tasks to complete

-   Add the Web API application to your AAD tenant.

-   Set the sign-on URL: http://\<your web api name\>.azurewebsites.net.

-   Add a new Reply URL, making it the same as the other one, but using https.

#### Exit criteria

-   You have saved the new key value for later.

-   You have copied and saved the Reply URLs for later.

-   You have copied and saved the Application ID and App ID URI values for later.

### Task 3: Expose Web API to other applications 

To make the Web API accessible to other applications added to Azure AD, you must define the appropriate permissions. You will modify the manifest for the Web API to configure these settings, since, as of now, the Azure portal does not provide an interface for this.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Expose the Web API to other applications by updating the manifest to enable **oauth2AllowImplicitFlow** and adding an **oauth2Permissions** entry that allows applications to read-write the Contoso Web API on behalf of the signed-in user.

#### Exit criteria

-   Your Web API manifest has been updated to enable oauth2AllowImplicitFlow.

-   You have an oauth2Permissions entry with the following information (replace the id value with a new GUID):

    ```
    {
        "adminConsentDescription": "Allow read-write access to the Contoso Insurance Web API on behalf of the signed-in user",
        "adminConsentDisplayName": "Read-Write access to Contoso Insurance Web API",
        "id": "494581dd-4bf5-451d-9bf8-487f4a43a09c",
        "isEnabled": true,
        "type": "User",
        "userConsentDescription": "Allow read-write access to the Contoso Insurance Web API on your behalf",
        "userConsentDisplayName": "Read-Write access to Contoso Insurance Web API",

## Appendix A: Create a self-signed certificate

For users who wish to run the PolicyConnect desktop application within its legacy configuration, you must create and configure a self-signed certification. SSL is used to encrypt communication between the desktop application and the WCF services, including SQL-based authentication. **This is not required to complete the lab successfully.**

### Task 1: Create self-signed certificate

1.  On the new VM, run the **Developer Command Prompt** for the appropriate version of Visual Studio as an [administrator]{.underline} from the Start menu.

2.  Browse to a folder location you wish to store the certificate files. Take note of the path.

3.  Run the following command to create the root CA, and execute:

    ```
    makecert -n "CN=RootCATest" -r -sv RootCATest.pvk RootCATest.cer
    ```

By default, no **makecert** tool is installed on Windows 10 PC. To install, you need to download Windows 10 SDK from here: <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk>.

4.  In the **Create Private Key Password** dialog box, select **None** without entering the password. Normally this is not recommended for security reasons but is acceptable for test purposes only.

5.  Now you will install the certificate in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities container.

6.  Select **Start**, then type **MMC** and then select **OK**. On Windows 10, you will need to type **mmc.exe** after selecting **Start**.

7.  In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), on the **File** menu, select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.

8.  In the **Add Standalone Snap-in** dialog box, select **Certificates** and then select **Add**.

    ![In the Add or Remove Snap-ins dialog box, the Certificates snap-in and the Add button are selected.](media/unguided-image52.png "Add or Remove Snap-ins dialog box")

9.  In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog box, select the **Computer account** radio button because the certificate needs to be made available to all users, and then select **Next**.

10. In the **Select Computer** dialog box, leave the default **Local computer** (the computer this console is running on) selected and then select **Finish**.

11. In the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box, select **OK**.

12. In the left pane, expand the **Certificates (Local Computer)** node, and then expand the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder.

13. Under **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, right-click the Certificates subfolder, select **All Tasks**, and then select **Import**.

14. On the **Certificate Import Wizard** welcome screen, select **Next**.

15. On the **File to Import** screen, select **Browse**.

16. Browse to the location of the signed Root Certificate Authority RootCATest.cer file copied in Step 3, select the file, and then select **Open**.

17. On the **File to Import** screen, select **Next**.

18. On the **Certificate Store** screen, accept the default choice and then select **Next**.

19. On the **Completing the Certificate Import Wizard** screen, select **Finish**.

    ![In the MMC window - console1, under Console Root\\Certificates (Local Computer), Trusted Root Certification Authorities is selected. Under Issued To, RootCATest is selected.](media/unguided-image53.png "MMC window - console1")

20. Leave the MMC window open, as it will be required below.

### Task 2: Create and install your temporary service certificate

1.  On the new VM, run the **Developer Command Prompt** for the appropriate version of Visual Studio as an [administrator]{.underline} from the Start menu, or switch over to the command prompt if you had left it open from the previous steps.

2.  Browse to the folder location you stored the certificate files.

3.  Type in the following command, replacing the \<\<YOUR MACHINE NAME\>\> with your machine name, and execute:

    ```
    makecert -sk ContosoInsurance -iv RootCATest.pvk -n "CN=<<YOUR MACHINE NAME>>" -ic RootCATest.cer -sr localmachine -ss my -sky exchange -pe
    ```
4.  Keep the command prompt open.

5.  You must now associate this certificate with all SSL transactions within IIS Express. To do this, **re-open the Certificates MMC snap-in** from the previous section.

6.  **Expand** the Personal certificates node on the Certificates tree to the left. You should see a certificate issued to your machine name and issued by RootCATest. **Double-click your certificate**, then select the **Thumbprint** field under the Details tab. **Copy the Thumbprint value**.

    ![In the MMC window - console1, under Certificate\\Personal, Certificates is selected. Under Issued To, the RootCATest certificate is selected. In the Certificate dialog box Details tab, the thumbprint value is selected.](media/unguided-image54.png "MMC window - console1, and Certificate dialog box")

7.  **Launch PowerShell** from the start menu. You will run a command to remove the spaces from the Thumbprint value you copied on the previous step. You will also execute a command to generate a new Guid value.

8.  From the PowerShell command prompt, **paste your certificate's thumbprint between double quotes** and execute the following command (replacing the thumbprint value with your own):

    \"a1 b6 9e 7a be 27 fe 21 fa c7 21 f5 40 72 9f c1 f5 8c dc 4e\" -replace \" \"

9.  **Copy the output value**, which is your thumbprint with the spaces removed.

10. Go back to the Visual Studio command prompt you left open on step 4. Type in the following command, but **do not execute yet**:

    > netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:44321 appid={c19c7312-ffe4-48da-85e3-f302ad80a625} certhash=a1b69e7abe27fe21fac721f540729fc1f58cdc4e

11. Replace the **certhash** value with the thumbprint you copied in the previous step. Replace the **appid** value with a newly generated Guid. To generate a Guid, switch pack to PowerShell and execute the following command:

    ```powershell
    [guid]::NewGuid()
    ```

12. Paste the output Guid value in between the curly braces next to **appid** in the Visual Studio command prompt.

13. Execute the netsh command. If you receive an error stating that the "SSL Certificate add failed," you may ignore it. The certificate is now associated with https communications over port 44321.

### Task 3: Configure the IIS Express self-signed certificate

1.  On the new VM, verify that the IIS Express developer certificate bound to localhost is present.

2.  Select **Start**, type **MMC,** and then select **OK**.

3.  In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), on the **File** menu, select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.

4.  In the **Add Remove Snap-in** dialog box, select **Add**.

5.  In the **Add Standalone Snap-in** dialog box, select **Certificates,** and then select **Add**.

6.  In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog box, select the **Computer account** radio button because the certificate needs to be made available to all users, and then select **Next**.

7.  In the **Select Computer** dialog box, leave the default **Local computer** (the computer this console is running on) selected, and then select **Finish**.

8.  In the **Add Standalone Snap-in** dialog box, select **Close**.

9.  In the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box, select **OK**.

10. In the left pane, expand the **Certificates (Local Computer)** node, and then expand the **Personal** folder.

11. You should see a certificate issued to and issued by "localhost".

    ![In the MMC window - console1 window, the certificate issued to localhost is selected.](media/unguided-image55.png "MMC window - console1")

12. If this certificate is not present, you will need to run a repair command for the IIS Express application. If it is present, continue to step 12.

    a.  Select **Start**, then type in **Programs and Features**. Select the **Programs and Features** application link.

    b.  Find and right-click on the IIS Express application listing, then select **Repair**.

       ![The right-click menu for IIS 10.0 Express displays with Repair selected.](media/unguided-image56.png "Repair menu option")

    c.  Once the repair has completed, go back to the Certificates MMC snap-in and verify that the localhost certificate is now present under the Personal folder.

13. From the Certificates MMC snap-in, right-click on the localhost certificate within the Personal certificates container, then choose **All Tasks Export**...

    ![In the MMC window - console1 window, under Certificates\\Personal, Certificates is selected. Under Issued to, the right-click menu for localhost displays, and All Tasks / Export is selected.](media/unguided-image57.png "MMC window - console1 window")

14. When the Certificate Export Wizard dialog appears, select **Next**. Under **Export Private Key**, select **Yes, export the private key**, and then click **Next**.

    ![The Certificate Export Wizard displays.](media/unguided-image58.png "Certificate Export Wizard")

15. Make sure the **Personal Information Exchange -- PKCS \#12 (.PFX)** file format is selected, and that the first checkbox (include all certificates in the certification path if possible) is checked, leaving the other three unchecked. Select **Next**..

    ![In the Certificate Export Wizard, Export File Format section, Personal Information Exchange -- PKCS \#12 (.PFX) is selected.](media/unguided-image59.png "Certificate Export Wizard")

16. Enter and confirm a password on the next step. **Make note of the password** for the certificate import process. Select **Next**.

17. Specify the name of your exported file by browsing to a folder and typing in the name of the file (such as localhost). Select **Next**.

18. Select **Finish** on the confirmation screen. You will receive a prompt stating that the export was successful. Select **OK** to close the dialog.

19. After the export is complete, expand the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** folder, then right-click on the Certificates subfolder and select **All Tasks...** **Import**.

20. Select **Next**, and then browse to the exported certificate location. You may need to select **Personal Information Exchange (\*.pfx,\*.p12)** from the file types dropdown next to the filename field in order to see your certificate listed. Select the certificate, select **Open**, and then **Next**.

21. Type the password you entered while exporting the certificate in step 15, then select **Next**.

22. Make sure that the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** certificate store is selected, then select **Next**, then **Finish**. You will receive a prompt stating that the import was successful. Select **OK** to close the dialog.
