## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft big data and advanced analytics.

By the end of the lab, you will be able to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies but not necessarily doing work in every component possible.

## Overview

Margie's Travel (MT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves and provide added value to their corporate customers.

They are looking to pilot a web app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional information useful to the traveler during the flight booking process. They want to enable their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to whether the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute or longer delay, considering the weather forecast for the departure hour.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The high-level overview diagram of the end-to-end solution is displayed. Flight delay data and historical airport weather data are provided to Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory provides this data to both blob storage and Azure Databricks. Azure Databricks scores the data and saves the results to a local table. Azure Databricks also creates, trains, and exports a machine learning model to the Azure Machine Learning Service. Azure Machine Learning service provides a containerized services that is consumed by the web portal. The web portal also consumes 3rd party API data for forecasted weather. Map data visualization is provided by Power BI using web portal information and the Azure Databricks table.](media/high-level-overview.png 'High-level overview diagram')

Duration: 60 minutes

In this Challenge, you will implement a classification experiment. You will load the training data from your local machine into a dataset. Then, you will explore the data to identify the primary components you should use for prediction and use two different algorithms for predicting the classification. You will then evaluate the performance of both algorithms and choose the algorithm that performs best. The model selected will be exposed as a web service integrated with the optional sample web app at the end.

If you are still having trouble, a zip file called AdventureWorksTravelDatasets.zip is included in the lab-files folders.

Extract the ZIP and verify you have the following files:

   - FlightDelaysWithAirportCodes.csv
   - FlightWeatherWithAirportCode.csv
   - AirportCodeLocationLookupClean.csv
